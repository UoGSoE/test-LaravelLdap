# Test app for https://github.com/UoGSoE/LaravelLdap

This is just a basic Laravel app which pulls in the https://github.com/UoGSoE/LaravelLdap code to run tests against it.  It was easier to do this as all the scaffolding for config/auth/views could be included.

If you want to run it yourself for some reason, make sure you set the env variables at the bottom of the .env file once you've copied it from .env.example.
